                    Research shows that many people learn about privacy and security risks from anecdotal stories shared by others, which influence their perceptions and actions. 
                    However, no studies have been conducted with children, who may also gain significant knowledge about security and privacy from peers, trusted adults, and social networks. To promote the creation and sharing of privacy stories, we created PrivacyToon, a concept-driven storytelling tool that facilitates the visual production of privacy stories and visualizations. The tool provides users with creative and technical drawing support, where a comic story can be created, downloaded, and shared while improving the reflection of privacy issues in the process. A comic authoring tool centers users in the creation process 
                    to tell their own narratives that express their lived digital experiences or lessons from stories. We discuss our ongoing research on PrivacyToon and its potential as a security and privacy learning interface for children.

                The increasing use of technology by adolescents exposes them to a wide range of benefits and risks. 
                While previous research has explored these risks, the context in which they occur can significantly affect their nature, making some risks more prominent and potentially severe than others. In this proposed study, we aim to identify the main online risks adolescents face during times of crisis, specifically during wartime. Additionally, we will investigate the strategies used by adolescents and their support network, including parents and teachers, to mitigate these risks and how they were informed about these practices. To this end, we will use two methodologies: 1) interview-based study, in which we will interview parents and adolescents about their online experiences and protective practices in an ongoing war; and 2) social media content-analysis study, 
                to learn about the practices people used to mitigate online risks as were suggested in SM discussions during the early stages to the war.

                While children are active smartphone users, studies suggest they often lack the ability to make informed privacy choices about smartphone applications. Consequently, there is a growing body of literature aiming to understand how children perceive and practice privacy on smartphone devices. However, methods to engage children, either for raising awareness or understanding their practices, are limited. In this paper, we present initial reflections on the engagement tool App Snap, 
                which we created to engage children around smartphone app privacy. Initial feedback shows promise, and researchers are already using the game as part of their data collection efforts.

                When an individual is motivated, they are more likely to initiate, pursue, and persist in activities. Motivation theories from educational psychology can further our comprehension of factors influencing learners' engagement in Security and Privacy Education (S&PE). However, the abstract nature of psychological concepts and the proliferation of theories can make it challenging for practitioners to examine and intervene motivation in S&PE. We drew upon the insights of a recently synthesized framework of motivation theories and designed Motivation Cards, which can be used to map an individual's motivational factors, providing a flexible and accessible approach for researchers and educators. 
                We discuss study opportunities for utilizing the cards in developing engaging solutions and behavior interventions in S&PE.

                Research on teen privacy often focuses on risk prevention, safety enhancement, and formal education, while the topic of how teens gain privacy-related knowledge and develop related skills in informal contexts remains under-explored. To understand how online interactions and discussions can support teens’ social learning, we are conducting a thematic analysis of contents from teen subreddit communities. Our initial findings indicate that teens acquire privacy-related knowledge from engaging with peers and adults online, 
                and that privacy breaches may also help them strengthen their privacy-related skills. We conclude by offering research and design implications on teens’ sense of control over their privacy as well as parental communications.
