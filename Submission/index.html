    <h2>Paper Submission</h2>
    <div>
        <p>We are soliciting short papers related to our workshop objectives:</p>
        <p>1. Previously published results;</p>
        <p>2. Work-in-progress;</p>
        <p>3. Proposals of design principles, processes, methods and/or solutions for specific educational contexts.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Submissions must use the SOUPS formatting template (available for <a href="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2024_soups.doc">MS Word</a> or <a href="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2024_soups_latex-template.zip">LaTeX</a>) and be submitted as a PDF via the HotCRP web submission system. 
        Submissions are <b>not</b> to be anonymous.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Submissions must be no more than 4 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices), though they may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material. We encourage authors to use the appendices for content that is peripheral to the main contributions of the paper but that may interest some readers or that may facilitate replication. Please note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        For more details, please refer to the Call for: <a href="https://spei2024.github.io/">Papers website</a>.
