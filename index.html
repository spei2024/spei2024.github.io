    <p>
        This workshop aims to pioneer the development of educational tools and interfaces that cater specifically to the privacy and security learning needs of teenagers, children, and multi-generational family groups. This initiative seeks to bridge the knowledge gap in digital privacy and security education by fostering an environment that encourages the collaborative creation of resources that are both engaging and informative. The workshop will serve as a platform for researchers, educators, and developers to share insights, challenges, and breakthroughs in crafting educational content that resonates with youth and families.
